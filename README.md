# Week 5 HW


The home work assigments get more challenging every week.  I feel like I can really see my progress from week one and I'm looking forward to how I can continue to grow.
Using the knowledge of what we learn in class and also pulling in knowledge from the outside to complete the assignments makes me feel like I am taking another step every week.
